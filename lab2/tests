In DotTreeGUI, I made a method called test2. This method inserted 9 Dots into the tree, and then called the PointQuadtree size and allPoints functions to ensure that they functioned appropriately. I knew that size should return 9, and the length of the list returned by allPoints should also be 9.

In CollisionGUI, I made a method called test. This method created 8 blobs, all of which intersect each other. I then called findColliders, and then checked to make sure that all 22 collisions had registered.
